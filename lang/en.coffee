    'Community Projects'

  SneakPeak: '''
  <p>Our community does a great job to develop new content! Here's a sneak peak:</p>
  '''

  Lorry: '''
    <p>Lorry is to become <i>the</i> platform for Clonk add-ons - CCAN 2.0, so to say!</p>
    '''

  OpenClonk: '''
    <p>OpenClonk is the successor of the Clonk game series, developed as open source project. The team explores completely new avenues like real time 3D models.</p>
    <p>But no worries, at its core the game remains our good old 2D platformer!</p>
    '''
   
  Eke: '''
  <p>Re-experience the tried and true game feeling of Eke. This time <i>inside your browser</i> with the online version!</p>
  '''
  WebClonk: '''
  <p>Another variant of Clonk for the browser. The ambitious goal: The entire world of Clonk, rebuilt for the web, with even dozens of people playing together in one map!</p>
  '''

  Devcom: '''
  <p>devcom-Clonk is an upcoming platform by developers for developers. Here you will find tutorials about everything related to scripting in Clonk. It focuses on bringing people together and giving newcomers a good start into development.</p>

  Quote: [
    '<p>Clonk is an exceptional game, with a community every bit as exceptional! Many of you are part of it for years by now - as are we.</p>'
    '''<p>By the <a href='http://www.clonk.de/forum/de/topic_show.pl?tid=10509'>announcement at the Clonk forum</a>, which was a shock for many of us, the days of having an official Clonk page as meeting place will probably be over.</p>'''
    '<p><b>Here, we want to provide a new home!</b></p>'
    '''<p>To make it really comfy here, we frequently tinker about with this site and are always open to your suggestions! Your wishes and ideas are also welcome in <a href='https://clonkspot.org/forum/forum_show.pl'><b>our forum</b></a>.</p>'''

  Whatyoucando: '''
    <h2>And how can you contribute?</h2>
    <p>A community lives only as long as its members are active. Many take the opportunity to play together via the master server. From that, many friendships originated already! Others like to participate actively in discussions and contribute new ideas. A part of the community primarily concentrates on developing new content. Development teams depend on small success stories and from others in the community playing the content and giving feedback about it.</p>
    <p>These are some more projects created in recent years:</p>

  # Development  
  
  Heading:
    'All roads lead to Clonk.'
  
  Intro:
    '''Clonk's strength is its openness for modding and additional content. But where to begin? Here! Let's get started.'''
  
  Mod:
    'These are the areas of modding for Clonk:'

  Graphics: '''
    <h3>Graphics</h3>
    <p>For ingame graphics, Clonk Rage only supports sprites (with images in PNG format). Animations are included with the regular graphics in the same file, and get overlaid ingame according to coordinates specified in a text file.
  '''

  Script: '''
    <h3>Script</h3>
    <p>The scripting language of Clonk, based on C, is called "C4Script". Used for all objects and scenarios, the engine interprets it to create all the wonderful behaviour you can see. Many functions are at your fingertips, but of course you're free to write your own.</p>
  '''

  Scenario: '''
    <h3>Levels</h3>
    <p>With only basic knowledge you're ready to build new levels! For static maps, Clonk reads bitmap graphics, or you draw them live ingame with the built-in tools. They also allow placing objects via drag'n'drop. Dynamic maps use a generator that reads map specifications from text files.</p>
  '''
  
  Scenario2: '''
    <p>By adding or replacing material textures, you can change the look to anything you want. Finally, with a scenario script you can create extensive worlds and stories!</p>
  '''

  Sound: '''
    <h3>Music & Sound </h3>
    <p>Another area for extensive modding. For sound, Clonk plays wave files. Additionally mid, xm, it, s3m, mod and ogg are supported for music. As powerful and free editing software, we recommend Audacity.</p>
